=====

Welcome to the developer testing section of ``pattoo-web``.

Running unittests
-----------------

You can run all the unittests in this directory by executing the ``bin/_do_all_tests.py`` script.

Duplicate Error Logging Codes
-----------------------------

``pattoo-shared`` tries to make it easy for developers and users to see where there are issues in the code, operating conditions or configuration by generously logging events.

The codes should be unique to make it easier to find the source of an issue.

Developers can use the output of the ``bin/error_code_report.py`` script to determine whether the logging error codes selected have duplicates. It will give an output like this.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ bin/error_code_report.py
   Pattoo Error Code Summary Report
   --------------------------------
   Starting Code              : 1001
   Ending Code                : 1569
   Duplicate Codes to Resolve : [1029, 1186]
   Available Codes            : [1007, 1008, 1010, 1011, 1012]
   $

Use ``grep`` or some other similar utility to determine the duplication location and then correct it.
